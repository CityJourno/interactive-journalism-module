# 4.1: R in the newsroom: the tidyverse


## JOM299 final project

two routes:

-   build a full website to host your final project
-   host your piece on a blog/Medium

for students picking option one&#x2026;


### here is a template!

[see on Github](https://github.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/tree/master/website-template)

HTML index file + CSS + Javascript from a web framework called Bootstrap.

contains all the assets you'd need, with pre-defined CSS and style rules. Download, take the bits you don't want out, play with it as much as you like, and **try to re-use bits of it.**

the purpose of that framework is to have you write as little basic CSS as possible!


## what is R

R is a programming language very popular among statisticians, researchers, and data scientists.

In addition to traditional data structures, R comes out of the box with regression models, time-series support, geo capabilities, and many stats shorthands.

## why R?

FiveThirtyEight, Buzzfeed, The Times, The Guardian, some German newsrooms&#x2026;

for some reason R has gained popularity in newsrooms among data specialists


### should I choose R or Python?

no right answer to this question!
R v Python: [an infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis)

-   many ways to write R: several schools of thought
-   Python is more consistent across users: meaningful indentation helps
-   you can do anything with Python, R is slightly more focused
-   Python online documentation/community is more beginner-friendly
-   pure salary from survey: R about +20% (one of the most top-paying languages)
    
    R isn't exactly the [Zen of Python&#x2026;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python)


## elements of syntax


### the basics

    # a comment
    
    # a variable
    foo <- 'bar'
    
    # a list, called a 'vector'
    foo <- c(1, 2, 'lol')


### functions and for loops?

the so-called "R way" is very much line-by-line, not that much oriented towards functions and iterators

    foo <- c(1, 3, 'some data', 'not to remove')
    foo_clean <- foo[-(1:2)]


## the tidyverse

there are several ways to write R. an important one follows Hadley Wickham's philosophy and work at RStudio.

it is called **[[<https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/>][the tidyverse]**

> The tidyverse is a coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share a common design philosophy

### tidy data

[principles of tidy data](https://hackyhour.github.io/Goettingen/slides/tidy_slides.html#/), a presentation (built in RStudio!) from Wickham's paper ["Tidy Data"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)


### a set of tools

example: the pipe \`%>%\`

    const foo = [1,2,10];
    foo.forEach(function(element) {
      if (element > 2) {
        return element;
      }
    });

    foo <- c(1,2,10)
    foo %>%
      filter( > 2)


### the pipe II

> The operators pipe their left-hand side values forward into expressions that appear on the right-hand side, i.e. one can replace f(x) with x %>% f(), where %>% is the (main) pipe-operator. 

    the_data <-
      read.csv('/path/to/data/file.csv') %>%
      subset(variable_a > x) %>%
      transform(variable_c = variable_a/variable_b) %>%
      head(100)


### pipes and verbs

    cars <- cars %>%
      mutate(pounds = weight / 1000)


## dplyr tutorial

<http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial.html>

-   \`select()\`
-   \`filter()\`
-   \`%>%\`
-   \`mutate()\`
-   \`group<sub>by</sub>()\`


### let's put that into practice: civilian casualties from Coalition bombings
