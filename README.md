## Module outline and aims

Digital journalists increasingly need a complex skillset of developer knowledge, as well as a native understanding of application programming interfaces (APIs) and ‘scraping’ of online sources to be able to interrogate and investigate ‘big data’ in the public interest.

This module, which follows on from ‘Introduction to Data Reporting aims to train you to work effectively a professional digital journalist. By the end of this module you will have an advanced knowledge of data journalism, including skills to investigate and interrogate ‘big data’; demonstrate developer skills in a range of coding languages; be able to interrogate application programme interfaces (APIs) and deploy scraping tools; critically evaluate data sets and complex investigations; and appreciate the accountability role of digital data reporting for civil society in advanced democracies.

## What will i be expected to achieve?

On successful completion of this module, you will be expected to be able to:

####Knowledge and understanding:

* Demonstrate a critical understanding of the importance of digital data reporting as aform of accountability journalism in democratic society
* Display an understanding of the roles, priorities and workflows of journalists, developers, and programmers who work with and enable the publication of digital journalism

####Skills:

* Use judgment to analyse and evaluate suitable sources of data and datasets
* Develop suitable problem-solving approaches to address typical challenges in a digitalnewsroom
