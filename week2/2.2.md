that's a photo essay without any interactive component to it.

lesson: there is "data" in the module name. read the spec and make sure you tick the boxes.


## week 5 presentations


### Reminder

> Pick one journalism piece/tool that illustrates a format or technique. Produce a presentation and report on the piece, how it's built, and the landscape of that format/technique in online journalism today.

## Running your Pythons


### solution one: the old way

A Python script is a file, eg **example.py**

You run this file through the ****command line**** with 

    > `python example.py`


### wait what?


### solution two: the notebook

Python also comes with a set of utilities bundled in a GUI: [the Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb)

We can run Python notebooks from the university computers.

## To write code, you use a text editor

[for example, Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

> Why not Word, Mac's TextEdit?

These softwares are word processors. They add <span class="underline">lots</span> of code around the words you actually see on screen.


## Let's see some syntax


### Variables

-   Strings

        variable = 'some text'
        
        print variable
        > some text

-   Integers

        variable = 1
        
        print variable
        > 1


### Variables (2): Lists

    list= [1, 2, 'basile']
    
    print(list)
    > [1,2,'basile']
    
    print(list[0])
    > 1
    
    print(list[1])
    > 2


### Variables (3): Objects/dictionaries

    addresses = {'Mum': '07439487463', 'Donal Trump': '573-555-5555'}
    
    print(addresses['Mum'])
    > 07439487463


### Conditional execution: \`if/else\`

    name = 'basile'
    if name is 'basile'
       print('okay!')
    
    > okay!


### Conditional execution: \`if/else\` (2)

    number = 10
    if number > 5:
        print('Wow, that's a big number!')


### Booleans

In Python, they are \`True\` and \`False\`

    1 == 1
    "test" != "testing"
    "test" == 1


### Control flow: \`for\` loop

    list_of_letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    
    for letter in list_of_letters:
        print(letter)


### Methods and functions

    def add_two(x):
        return x + 2
    
    var = 1
    print(var)
    > 1
    
    add_two(var)
    > 3
    
    add_two('basile')
    > ERROR


## web scraping free text in python

### output

This is a comma-separated values format, where every line in the file is a data record.

    MP,Party,Constituency
    Heidi Alexander ,Labour,Lewisham East
    Rushanara Ali ,Labour,Bethnal Green and Bow
    Mr Graham Allen ,Labour,Nottingham North
    Lyn Brown ,Labour,West Ham
    Chris Bryant ,Labour,Rhondda
    Ms Karen Buck ,Labour,Westminster North

### How?

-   Open the page
-   Fire up your DevTools
-   Tinker with the DOM to spot the consistency
-   Understand the tree structure to reach the elements you want

Scraping is all about targeting the right element(s), and/or identifying the patterns in the document.

Because through programming, patterns can be pried open and stripped bare, leaving only the relevant information.
