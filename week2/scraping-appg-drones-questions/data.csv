For example the offences of endangering the safety of an aircraft, and endangering the safety of any person or property, apply to the users of all drones. There are also offences specific to users of small drones, and those using drones for aerial works. Please see at the end of the answer below for a list of these provisions.The Civil Aviation (Insurance) Regulations 2005 deal with insurance requirements for drones, and contain offences to enforce these.Offences relating to personal data are provided for in the Data Protection Act 1998.Other legislation which is not aviation or transport specific may also be relevant to addressing criminal use of drones.On future regulation, a proposed new EU Regulation on aviation safety is currently being negotiated with the European Aviation Safety Agency and other EU Member States. This will apply to all drones.While the Government considers that there are comprehensive rules in place to guard against criminal use of drones, we continue to keep under careful review whether there is any need for further legislation in this area.Provisions in ANO which are enforced by offences listed in Schedule 13 ANOa) Relevant to all drones:Article 137 - endangering safety of an aircraftArticle 138 - endangering safety of any person or propertyb) Relevant to drones above 20kg (those over 150kg have additional requirements to meet):Article 3 - registration (unless comply with B Conditions - see Schedule 2 ANO)Article 16 - certificate of airworthiness (unless comply with B Conditions)Article 21 - issue of national permits to flyArticle 31 - dropping articles for purposes of agriculture etcArticle 129 - dropping of articles and animalsc) Relevant to drones up to 20kg:Article 166 - requirements for small unmanned aircraftApplying to person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft of 20kg or less (without fuel but including equipment):article 166(1) - Causing or permitting an article or animal to be dropped from a small unmanned aircraft so as to endanger persons or property.article 166(2) - Flying without being reasonably satisfied that the flight can be safely made.article 166(3) - Failing to maintain direct, unaided visual contact sufficient to monitor flight path.article 166(5) - Flying for the purposes of aerial work without permission.Applying to person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft 7kg – 20kg (without fuel but including equipment):article 166(4)(a) - Flying in Class A, C, D or E airspace without the permission of the appropriate Air Traffic Control unit,article 166(4)(b) - Flying within an Air Traffic Zone during the notified hours of watch without permission,article 166(4)(c) - Flying at a height of more than 400ft above the surface unless within 166(4)(a) or (b).Article 167 - requirements for small unmanned surveillance aircraft.Applying to person in charge of a small unmanned surveillance aircraft of 20kg or less (without fuel but including equipment):article 167(1) - Flight over or within 150m of a congested area,article 167(1) &amp; (2)(b) - Flight over or within 150m of an organised open-air assembly or more than 1,000 persons without permission,article 167(1) &amp; (2)(c) - Flight within 50m of any vessel, vehicle or structure or person (not under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft) without permission,article 167(3) - Taking off within 30m of a person (not under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft).",http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2016-04-28/36085/,Civil Use,UK

It reflects the necessity for the Armed Forces of a democracy such as the UK not just to conduct military operations in a highly disciplined, careful and proportionate manner within the rule of law, but to demonstrate transparency and accountability for such activity. The need for this is all the more important when the military operations are being conducted against a terrorist organisation such as ISIL which wholly disregards the rule of law and relies on a perverted ideology and deceitful propaganda.

Our efforts, and those of the coalition as a whole, have helped check ISIL’s advance and assisted the Iraqis in liberating a number of important towns.

Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr Hammond), co-hosted, with US Secretary of State John Kerry, a conference on 22 January to push forward other streams of work including disrupting ISIL’s funding streams, tackling foreign fighters, and countering ISIL’s twisted ideology. In Syria, Assad must continue to bear responsibility for the savage civil war and the harrowing impact it is having on his own people. He is a catalyst of terrorism, not its cure. So it is vital that we keep supporting moderate voices and keep pushing for a political settlement that ends the civil war.

Friend the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Alistair Burt) on 17 June 2013 (Official Report, column 734) on the subject of autonomous weapons.The phrase meaningful human control is an emergent concept which the UK is mindful of and working to define with interested parties in step with technological and doctrinal developments. However, in practical terms, in UK operations every target is assessed by a human, and every release of weapons is authorised by a human; other than in a very small number of instances, all targets are also acquired by a human. The exception is in a small number of defensive anti-materiel systems e.g. Phalanx.

The consortium (which includes Oxford and Cambridge Universities, the Transport Systems Catapult and other partners) will develop small pod-like vehicles capable of carrying up to two passengers and which will ultimately be capable of autonomous operations.BIS has previously funded a two year automation programme with the British Automation and Robot Association that ended in September 2013. The £600,000 programme over two years enabled the provision of a one day manufacturing review and diagnostic to small and medium-sized enterprises on the potential to apply robotics and automation in their businesses. The programme also provided the opportunity for more detailed interventions. Over 268 one day reviews were carried out, and more detailed interventions accounted for a further 282 days of advice.Research CouncilsThe Research Councils current investment into research related to the commercial application of robotics is £36.5 million, which includes a £10 million investment through the Natural Environment Research Council into Marine Autonomous Systems.Technology Strategy BoardThe TSB is the prime channel through which Government supports business-led technology innovation. Since 2010 it has invested £8 million in robotics and robotics related projects, helping business develop and commercialise new products and services.The TSB is arranging an entrepreneur-led overseas delegation to the US in June 2014 to develop the UK’s brand in robotics and to engage with the rapidly growing robotics cluster in San Francisco and San Diego. This creates a real opportunity for UK robotics companies to capitalise on this growth and take a lead in integrating their technologies in a range of markets that could exploit them. The message behind the mission is that the UK is open for business and has innovative robotics companies that are interested in the US market and are ready to engage in dialogue, form partnerships and do business in the international arena.In addition, the Government (through TSB) has previously funded research and demonstration of civil Unmanned Aerial Vehicles through the £62 million ASTRAEA programme over the past seven years. The programme has made possible the ‘unmanned’ flight of a Jetstream 31 from Lancashire to Inverness, clocking up to 2,500 miles in flights between Lancashire and Inverness and around the Irish Sea.UK Space AgencyThe UK Space Agency encourages and supports companies and research organisations to spin-out technology developed through space exploration into non-space sectors.

RPAS is used on the DEFRA estate, over third party property with the owner&#039;s permission, and in areas where the owner or occupier is unknown.Where RPAS is used over the DEFRA estate, personal data is not captured. Where RPAS is used to capture images away from the estate, the data captured should be considered to be personal data, as defined by the DPA, if the land is owned or rented by natural, living persons. This is because it contains information about personal property, such as types of crops growing at a specific location, which can be linked to a natural person.This type of data is considered low sensitivity.DEFRA provides guidance on the Data Protection Act&#039;s 8 data protection principles (DPPs) in part I of schedule 1 to the DPA.

No specific study has been conducted by the Ministry of Defence into the psychological effects of using RPAS and indeed, it would be difficult to measure such effects quantitatively. However, empirical evidence based on observation and post-operational reporting suggests that the presence of an aircraft (manned or remotely piloted) modifies the behaviour of insurgents such as the Taliban.

The following table details the three projects being delivered by those named contractors that are currently assessed as running over budget. (The table can be found in the link to the full text of the question on Hansard).For the purpose of answering this question, my officials have examined all Category A-D equipment acquisition projects, but limited to those showing a variance of more than £1 million against their approval costs, 50% confidence figure. It is also limited to those projects where the named company is listed as the prime contractor or where projects are being delivered by subsidiaries of the named companies. It does not include support projects. This was necessary to avoid significantly exceeding the disproportionate cost threshold limit for answering parliamentary questions. This approach means that there are some differences between the above table and the list provided to you in my answer of 6 November 2012, Official Report, column 519W, for example the inclusion of the A400M supplied by Airbus Ltd. as a subsidiary of EADS. The differences are due to the filters placed upon the data as explained above, as well as the passage of time. It should be noted that the cost variation quoted is assessed against MOD project approval figures, which represent the total MOD costs for any particular project. They therefore do not necessarily reflect contractual obligations. Project performance can be affected by a number of reasons, not all of which are in the contractor&#039;s control.

It currently plays a vital role in-military operations in Afghanistan where it is an important means of giving our ground forces the vital information they need to stay one step ahead of the enemy. It has proved to offer great military benefit and its presence has undoubtedly saved the lives of many UK and coalition forces. The UK complies fully with its obligations under international law including that set out in Article 36 of Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva conventions, to review all new weapons and means and methods of warfare (a process that applies equally to unmanned capabilities and other manned weapon systems). The UK Reaper system can only release its weapons when commanded to do so by the fully trained and qualified flight crew operating it from the ground. In Afghanistan, the policy governing the use of Reaper is identical to that for conventionally piloted combat aircraft. UK forces in Afghanistan come under the command of the NATO International Security and Assistance Forces (ISAF) and operate in accordance with international humanitarian law (also known as the law of armed conflict) and UK rules of engagement. Military lawyers based in Afghanistan advise on all aspects of operations including the selection and prosecution of all ISAF targets, which is the subject of a rigorous process that is compliant with international humanitarian law.

10 January 2012,To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish his Department&#039;s policy including legal assessment on the use of strike-equipped drone aircraft.,"John Spellar, Labour","A range of capabilities is available to UK forces operating in Afghanistan including the Reaper armed Remotely Piloted Aircraft System. The UK Reaper system does not have the capability to deploy weapons autonomously and can only release its weapons when commanded to do so by the fully trained and qualified flight crew operating on the ground. The policy governing the use of Reaper is identical to that for conventionally piloted combat aircraft operating in Afghanistan. UK forces in Afghanistan come under the command of the NATO International Security and Assistance Forces (ISAF) and in doing so operate in accordance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) (also known as the Law of Armed Conflict) and UK Rules of Engagement. Military lawyers based in Afghanistan advise on all aspects of operations and the selection and prosecution of all ISAF targets is the subject of a rigorous process that is compliant with IHL.
