# 1.1: The basics


## module information

Module code: JOM299
Title: Advanced Data and Coding

-   Module and assessment outline
-   The self-learner attitude
-   Useful resources
-   Intro to the DevTools, the DOM, and debugging your things


## topics covered in this module

-   Introduction to programming and the web with Javascript
-   Basic web scraping with Python
-   Exploratory analysis and day-to-day work with R
-   Putting charts on the web


## module outline and goals according to the spec

-   Develop a **complex skillset**
-   Gain an **understanding of data** and of modern digital journalism
-   Develop a **problem-solving philosophy**
-   Acquire **self-direction in learning**


## and I add to this:

**Have a crucial advantage over others in the industry**


## assessment: mark split between&#x2026;


### 25% presentation and brief

Will take place on **week 5**

i.e.

-   Wed 21
-   or Fri 23


### 75% final project

mid-April?


## cherry on top: build in JS week 3

> Build a simple interactive thing, in Javascript. This can be a series of buttons on which to click to change a displayed information, for example. The action triggered will involve a function. Example: display "1". Upon clicking this button, a function adds 2 and displays "3". Ask the user for a number to add, display the result of 3+n.

We'll talk about this project in class


## assessment two: final project

> Your project should identify and solve a journalistic problem, using data and coding work. Typically this will focus on a story &#x2013; either a complete story or an interactive feature forming part of a story. It could also be something for use in a newsroom (eg a tool helpful to journalists). 

that's from the course specs


## more about the final project

Your project must be relevant to journalism (see above), operate at a functional level (at least as a working prototype), and involve all of the following:

-   data techniques, involving scraping, cleaning, analysis and/or presentation, as needed/appropriate to your project
-   adding value through user interactivity
-   use and modification of html, CSS, Javascript, Python, R, d3
-   and/or other code (not simply plug-and-play elements)
-   use of free and/or low-cost tools
-   problem-solving.

(that's also from the spec)


## the self-learner attitude - what is that?

I want you to engage in the community of data-journalists, news hackers and tinkerers

## without further ado&#x2026;


## what is the DOM?

[<http://domenlightenment.com/#1.1>]

> The DOM is a hierarchy/tree of Javascript node objects

-   It looks like the HTML you wrote
-   It actually is the programming interface around it


## programming interface?

    <body>
      <article>
        <h1>This is a simple title</h1>
    
        <h1 id="special">This is another title... 
          <em>with a twist!</em>
        </h1>
      </article>
    </body>

The Dev Tools: the Swiss army knife of web work

What you can do with Dev Tools:

-   Edit the DOM directly
-   Change styles of any page
-   See Javascript code and errors
-   See and edit any file loaded by the page


## let's access the Dev Tools

On Chrome and Firefox

-   \`Ctrl\` + \`Shift\` + \`I\`
-   or \`Cmd\` + \`Opt\` + \`I\` on a Mac


## do things with the Dev Tools

Inspect and edit pages and style: 

-   [exercise one](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/)
-   [exercise two](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-styles)
-   [exercise three](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-dom)


## editing HTML with the Dev Tools

Example: make Donald Trump say anything with the Dev Tools!


## hiding things with the Dev Tools

Example: hide something on the [Google homepage](https://www.google.co.uk/)
