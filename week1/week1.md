The DOM
========================================================

What is the DOM?   
<http://domenlightenment.com/#1.1>

**The DOM is a hierarchy/tree of Javascript node objects**

* It looks like the HTML you wrote
* It actually is the programming interface around it

The DOM
========================================================


```
<body>

  <article>
  
    <h1>This is a simple title</h1>

    <h1 id="special">This is another title... 
      <em>with a twist!</em>
    </h1>
    
  </article>
  
</body>
```

- See Javascript code and errors
- See and edit any file loaded by the page

Access the Dev Tools
========================================================

On Chrome and Firefox
- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` 
- or `Cmd` + `Opt` + `I` on a Mac
