## Acquire self-direction in learning

## Have a crucial advantage over others in the industry

The self-learner attitude
========================================================
### The hacker ethic (Steven Levy)

* **Sharing**
* **Openness**
* **All information should be free**
* **Meritocracy**
* Decentralization
* Free access to computers
* Computers can change your life for the better

The self-learner attitude
========================================================

Assessment: Final Project(75%)
========================================================

Your project should identify and solve a journalistic problem, using data and coding work. Typically this will focus on a story -- either a complete story or an interactive feature forming part of a story. It could also be something for use in a newsroom (eg a tool helpful to journalists). 

Assessment: Final Project(75%)
========================================================
Your project must be relevant to journalism (see above), operate at a functional level (at least as a working prototype), and involve all of the following:
* data techniques, involving scraping, cleaning, analysis and/or presentation, as needed/appropriate to your project
* adding value through user interactivity
* use and modification of html, CSS, Javascript, Python, R, d3 
* and/or other code (not simply plug-and-play elements)
* use of free and/or low-cost tools
* problem-solving.


It's about the story
========================================================

## Never forget this: it's *always* about the story you're telling

What you build and how you build it will follow your story

The DOM
========================================================


```
<body>

  <article>
  
    <h1>This is a simple title</h1>

    <h1 id="special">This is another title... 
      <em>with a twist!</em>
    </h1>
    
  </article>
  
</body>
```

The DOM
========================================================

What is the DOM?   
<http://domenlightenment.com/#1.1>

**The DOM is a hierarchy/tree of Javascript node objects**

* It looks like the HTML you wrote
* It actually is the programming interface around it


The Dev Tools: the Swiss army knife of web work
========================================================

What you can do with Dev Tools:
- Edit the DOM directly
- Change styles of any page
- See Javascript code and errors
- See and edit any file loaded by the page

Access the Dev Tools
========================================================

On Chrome and Firefox
- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` 
- or `Cmd` + `Opt` + `I` on a Mac


Dev Tools

Do things with the Dev Tools
========================================================
Inspect and edit pages and style: 

- <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/>
- <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-styles>
- <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-dom>


The Dev Tools: edit HTML
========================================================

Example: make Donald Trump say anything with the Dev Tools!

The Dev Tools: hide some things
========================================================

Example: hide something on the [Google homepage](https://www.google.co.uk/)
